# 收到一封奇怪的邮件
今天翻垃圾箱时发现了一封邮件，内容如下：

> My beloved friend,
> I sent this mail praying for it to reach you in good health, since I myself are in a very critical health condition in which I sleep every night without knowing if I may be alive next day. My name is Mrs. Sarah Al moubi, a widow suffering from long time illness. I have some funds I inherited from my late husband, which I will need the help of a person like you to assist for this desired project, as my Doctor told me recently that I would not last due to the illness. Having known my condition, I decided to donate this fund to a good person that will utilize it the way I am going to instruct herein. I need a very honest and God fearing person who can use it for Charity works, for orphanages, widows and also build schools for less privilege that will be named after my late husband if possible.
>
> The sum is currently deposited in an existing bank. Your role will be to:
>
> [1]. Receive the funds into a business/private bank account.
> [2]. Invest/donate the funds to any orphanage home.
> [3]. Value of funds: (USD) $10.5 Million.
>
> I accept this decision because I do not have any child who will inherit this money after me.
> Please I want your sincerely and urgent answer to know if you will be available for this project, and I will give you more information on how the fund will be transferred to you. And everything will be done legally to ensure that the funds are transferred to you.
>
> I am waiting for your reply.
>
> Thank you,
> Mrs. Sarah Al moubi.

并不知道是我的哪个邮箱收到的，所以猜不出是什么网站上得到的邮箱。
我到底该不该相信呢？
